# Kickflip SDK for iOS

The [Kickflip](http://kickflip.io) platform provides a complete video broadcasting solution for your iOS application. You can use our pre-built `KFBroadcastViewController` to stream live video to your Kickflip account starting with one line of code. Check out our [Kickflip iOS SDK example](https://github.com/Kickflip/kickflip-ios-example) to get started.

## Quickstart

The quickest way to get started will be to fork the [Kickflip iOS SDK example](https://github.com/Kickflip/kickflip-ios-example). Launch Kickflip's default `KFBroadcastViewController` to instantly stream live video from your application:

```objc
#import "Kickflip.h"
// Call setup as soon as possible so your users can start streaming right away
[Kickflip setupWithAPIKey:@"API_KEY" secret:@"API_SECRET"];
...
- (void) broadcastButtonPressed:(id)sender {
	[Kickflip presentBroadcasterFromViewController:self ready:^(KFStream *stream) {
        if (stream.streamURL) {
            NSLog(@"Stream is ready at URL: %@", stream.streamURL);
        }
    } completion:^(BOOL success, NSError* error){
        if (!success) {
            NSLog(@"Error setting up stream: %@", error);
        } else {
            NSLog(@"Done broadcasting");
        }
    }];
}
```

## CocoaPods Setup

You'll need to install [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) first.
    
Add the following line to your `Podfile`:

    pod 'Kickflip'

Then run CocoaPods to install all of the dependencies:

    $ pod install

As with all projects that depend on CocoaPods, make sure to open the new `.xcworkspace` file, not your `.xcodeproj` file.
